Vehicle ergonomics is a critical factor in ensuring driver safety, comfort, and performance. Traditional tools like RAMSIS are extensively used for posture simulation and discomfort evaluation but often come with limitations in accessibility, cost, and flexibility. This study introduces a novel machine learning-based approach for discomfort index prediction aimed at enhancing the ergonomic assessment process.The proposed model leverages joint coordinate data and corresponding discomfort index values, collected through detailed posture simulations in RAMSIS. 
To integrate seamlessly into existing workflows, the project explores the deployment of the model through a REST API, allowing direct integration with CAD software such as CATIA. This integration enables real-time discomfort predictions during vehicle design and validation stages, reducing reliance on expensive third-party tools.
The results demonstrate that the machine learning model achieves high accuracy in predicting discomfort indices, validated against existing RAMSIS data. By combining computational efficiency, accuracy, and user-friendly integration, this approach has the potential to revolutionize ergonomic assessments in automotive design. This work provides a foundation for further advancements in predictive ergonomics and its application in human-centric vehicle design.
